      <p>Hello, my name is Sohail Zafar. I  have helped organize, start and run many family businesses. From restaurants to gas stations,
        my family has been successful in owning their business. My career in the High Tech world includes working my way up from a Technician 
        to Engineering Technician 2.I am good at programming several different computer languages and enjoy learning new technologies. I see my 
        future as a full stack programmer working on web applications and continue learning the software business.  With my business background
         and computer skills I know I will be a great asset to any software business. Thank you for time.
